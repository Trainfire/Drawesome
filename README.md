# Drawesome

Drawesome is a clone of the Jackbox game 'Drawful'.

The server is written as a standard C# console app and the the client was created in Unity 5.3. Both utilise HTML5 WebSockets for communication, with the former using Fleck and the latter using a form of Websocket-Sharp that has been adapted to work with Unity and WebGL.

(This is a barebone readme, as you can probably tell.)
